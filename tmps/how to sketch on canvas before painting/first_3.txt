<h2> Do artists sketch on canvas before painting? </h2>

Most painters will do at least a rough sketch on the canvas before painting. This helps to get the proportions and position of things right before you start painting. You can use a pencil, charcoal, pastels or even thinned paint with a smaller brush just to get the idea of an outline.<br><br>

Drawing is a great way to learn the basics of concepts like shape, form, light, and shadow. It also increases accuracy in painting, since you're working with lines rather than painting freehand. And it's easier to control proportion when you can see the scale first when drawing, before you start painting.<h3> How do I make a sketch on canvas </h3>

When sealing pencil drawings, there are a few options to choose from, such as diluted gesso, Spectrifix, Krylon Fixative Aerosol, and other fixative sprays that contain shellack. TIP: Use Graphite and soft pastels. They are popular drawing mediums when sketching out a design on canvas and can be sealed with the above-mentioned sealants.<h2> What is best to use to sketch on canvas? </h2>

The easiest way to draw on canvas before painting is to use a simple graphite pencil. However, this is not the most recommended method by professional artists. The most used methods by pro artists are the transfer method, white charcoal pencil, or a water-soluble pencil.<br><br>

When working with oils, it's best to use a regular graphite pencil to draw everything out. This is because the oils will remove the graphite from the paper (it just mixes into the paint), so you won't end up with any unwanted lines.

You can also use tracing/transfer paper to get your image onto the canvas. Just use dark transfer paper so that it's easier to see.
