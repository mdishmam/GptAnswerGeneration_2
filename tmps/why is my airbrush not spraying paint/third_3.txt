<h2> How do you adjust air pressure in an airbrush? </h2>


To adjust the compressor on an airbrush gun, first turn the compressor on and check the pressure gauge. The ideal pressure for airbrushing is around 30 psi. If the gauge is reading higher or lower than this, use the knob on the back of the compressor to adjust the pressure accordingly.<br><br>

Hi there,

Acrylic paint can be a great choice for an airbrush, as long as you use a high flow acrylic paint and a thinner. Golden makes a wonderful Airbrush Medium that works as a thinner for acrylic paints. Just remember that consistency is key - you're looking for a skim milk consistency or thinner.

Hope this helps!<h3> Why is my airbrush sputtering? </h3>

If you have a dual-action airbrush gun, spitting can be caused by not following your paint spray with a burst of air. Dual-action guns work by depressing the trigger for air, pulling back for paint, then depressing for air again. If you don't finish a spray with air, the gun will spit the next time you press down.<br><br>

If you're getting spider webs it's probably a combination of the paint being too thin and you're too close to what you're trying to paint. If you're adding thinner to the paint, just add less. If you're putting undiluted paint directly into your airbrush and it's still too thin, back away from the model.<h2> Do you need a moisture trap for airbrush? </h2>


If you're using an airbrush, it's important to always put a moisture trap onto your airbrush! This will help to ensure that the airbrush is always working properly and that the paint job always looks its best.<br><br>
