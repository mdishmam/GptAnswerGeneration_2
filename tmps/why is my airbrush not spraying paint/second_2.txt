<h2> Can I use paint thinner to clean my airbrush? </h2>


As said above, in the case of acrylic paints, thinners are basically a thinner version of the acrylic 'vehicle' which holds the pigment in the paint and so, if you try to use it to clean an airbrush it will actually leave a residue of clear acrylic inside the brush which is not what you want or, in the case of water-based paints, will just cause the paint to go all runny and not work properly. You need to use a cleaner specifically designed for airbrushes which will remove all the paint and thinner from the brush and leave it clean and ready for the next colour.<br><br>
If you do not have an airbrush cleaner at hand, you can use some alcohol / isopropanol or window cleaner. If these liquids are colored, spray them with water afterwards. Finally, let air through the gun so that there is no residual moisture in the duct.<h3> How do you backflush an airbrush? </h3>

With the needle cap removed, take your thumb and index finger and insert them into the back of the airbrush. Gently pull the trigger while holding the airbrush upside down so that any paint that is in the airbrush is forced out.<br><br>

I'm having trouble getting my airbrush to spray paint. The trigger seems to be working fine, but the paint isn't coming out.
