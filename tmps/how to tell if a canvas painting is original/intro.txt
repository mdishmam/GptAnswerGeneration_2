In order to tell if a canvas painting is original, you will need to examine the painting closely. Look for signs of wear and tear, such as brushstrokes that appear faded orstretched. Also, look for any discrepancies in the paint itself, such as missingdots of paint or smears. If the painting is signed, make sure that the signature matches the artist's known signature.<br><br>

If you're not sure whether a canvas painting is original or not, there are a few things you can look for. First, check to see if the painting is signed by the artist. If it is, that's a good indication that it's an original. Another thing you can do is look at the brushstrokes on the painting. If they're rough and textured, that's usually a sign that it's an original. Finally, check the overall condition of the painting. If it's in good condition, with no major wear or tear, it's likely to be an original.
