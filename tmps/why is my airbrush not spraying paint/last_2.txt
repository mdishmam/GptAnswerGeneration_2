<h2> How often should you clean your airbrush? </h2>

It's true of anything with working parts: proper upkeep means a longer life. One of the keys to keeping your airbrush in good working order is keeping it clean. Clean it after every use. Use a mild soap and warm water solution, and brush lightly with a soft brush. Rinse well and allow to air dry.<br><br>
It's important to clean your airbrush gun after each use to prevent clogs and ensure optimal performance. Here's a quick and easy guide on how to clean an airbrush gun.

1. Add warm water to the airbrush gun and dump it out into a trash can or cup of water.

2. Add a little more water and dump it out.

3. With the gun plugged in and on, submerge the needle and cup into a bowl of warm water and pull the trigger.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the water runs clear.

5. Dry the airbrush gun with a clean cloth and store it in a safe place.<h3> How do you unstick an airbrush needle? </h3>

If you have a needle that is stuck in your airbrush, there are a few things you can try to get it out. First, try twisting the needle to see if it will break free. You may have to let it soak for a while. If the needle still doesn't want to come out easy, remove the nozzle.<br><br>

Nozzles and needles come in different sizes which will determine the amount of paint that can be sprayed. Sizes often vary between 0.10mm and 0.5mm on airbrushes to 0.6 and 1.5mm on small spray guns. The smaller the nozzle/needle size, the finer the spray and the greater control you will have.
