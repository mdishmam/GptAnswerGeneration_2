It's recommended that you use a 60 gallon tank with a 5-6 HP compressor to paint your car. Look for a compressor that has a CFM rating of 14-18 at 90 PSI. This will provide enough air to power your spray gun.<br><br>
A 50 liter tank is not really big enough, you need at least 100 liters. A small tank runs out of air as you are spraying so the paint reduces as you are spraying.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlvubTzYmSQ" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
