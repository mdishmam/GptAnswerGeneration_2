<h2> What size air compressor do I need to paint a car? </h2>


Most air compressors with an air tank capacity of 30 gallons and up can usually handle painting a car. If you're painting a classic full-size car or want to play it safe, a tank of 60 gallons or more should be enough to coat the vehicle in a single pass.<br><br>

A 30 gallon air compressor is a great choice for both residential and commercial tasks. They provide compressed air that can power up a variety of tools like paint sprayers, rock drills, atomizers, nail guns, wrenches and several others.<h3> How big of an air compressor do I need for a paint gun </h3>

While some air spray guns have a rating of lower than 10 CFM, it is recommended that the compressor CFM for spray painting is at least 12 CFM. This is because a higher CFM will allow for a more consistent spray pattern and will minimize the risk of paint buildup on the gun. For professionals, this figure may need to be even higher â€“ the important thing is to check your spray gun's CFM requirements and choose a compressor that exceeds that figure.<br><br>

A larger tank size will usually mean that you can coat an entire vehicle in one pass, without having to stop and refill. This is especially important if you are coating a large vehicle, or if you want to avoid having to stop in the middle of your project.<h2> How many psi does it take to paint a car? </h2>


When spraying base coat you want to spray at about 26-29 PSI. The way you read this is at your gun, trigger pulled air flowing through and your dial reading 26 psi. When spraying clear coat I like to up the pressure 2-3 psi for a little more atomization and better flow out.<br><br>

If you're looking for a pressure air compressor that's easy to move around, the McGRAW 21-Gallon 175 PSI Oil-Free Vertical Air Compressor is a great option. It has wheels and a handle for easy maneuverability, and it's quiet compared to other models.
