If you're wondering whether you can paint a car with a 30 gallon air compressor, the answer is yes! However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you'll need to make sure that the air compressor is powerful enough to support the paint job. Second, you'll need to take the time to prepare the surface of the car properly before painting. And third, you'll need to be careful not to overspray the car with paint.<br><br>

No, you would need a much larger compressor to paint a car.
