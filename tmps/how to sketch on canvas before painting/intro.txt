When starting a painting, it is always helpful to do a sketch first. This allows you to plan out your composition and get a feel for the overall painting. It also helps to have a reference point to start from when painting on canvas. To do a sketch, simply use a pencil or charcoal to draw your desired composition onto the canvas. You can also use a light box to trace your sketch if you want a more precise line. Once you have your sketch down, you can start painting!<br><br>

This is a difficult question. I'm not sure how to answer it.
