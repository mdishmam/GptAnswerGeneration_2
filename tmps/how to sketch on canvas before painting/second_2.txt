<h2> Can you paint over pencil on canvas? </h2>


The main advantage of painting on canvas with acrylics is the fast drying time. This means that you can work on your painting for a longer period of time without having to worry about the paint drying out and ruining your work. Additionally, acrylic paint will not bleed into the oil paint once it is dry, making it a great option for those who want to create mixed media paintings.<br><br>

I have found the best way to remove pencil off a canvas is to use hand soap and a damp rag. It will take some elbow grease, but it will eventually come off.<h3> What do you use to outline a canvas </h3>


First, don't think that means you have to trace tracing. And transfer paper works great even if you don't have a light box! I use it all the time when I wanna do something like this “quilt as you go” method on a larger project.<br><br>

If you want to start the underpainting on your canvas, you can go ahead and do so. However, you may have to deal with streaks from the graphite or pencil. To prevent this, use a flat, thin brush to apply a thin layer of gesso over the sketch. This will protect the sketch while still allowing it to be visible.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHRer2BvVWc" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
